    <h1>Chiles en Nogada</h1>
    <p>Chiles en nogada is one of Mexico’s most emblematic dishes, celebrated for its balance of savory, sweet, and creamy flavors, as well as its striking tricolor presentation that mirrors the Mexican flag. The dish starts with roasted poblano chiles that are carefully peeled to keep their structure intact. These chiles are then filled with picadillo, a warm, aromatic mixture of ground or finely chopped meat combined with seasonal fruits like apple, pear, and peach, plus nuts, spices, and sometimes candied cactus.</p>
    <p>The defining element is the nogada, a silky walnut cream sauce made from fresh walnuts, milk or cream, a touch of sherry, and subtle spices. When properly prepared, the sauce is thick, slightly sweet, and naturally pale — not drowned in sugar and not overly blended; the goal is a delicate, almost velvety texture.</p>
    <p>The dish is finished with pomegranate seeds and fresh parsley, delivering a burst of acidity and herbaceous freshness on top of the rich cream and savory filling. Traditionally served at room temperature, chiles en nogada is a seasonal dish associated with late summer and early fall, when pomegranates and fresh walnuts are at their peak.</p>
