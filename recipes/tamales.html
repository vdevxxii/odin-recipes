    <h1>Tamales</h1>
    <p>Tamales are a traditional Mexican dish made from masa, a dough derived from nixtamalized corn, that is filled with savory or sweet ingredients, wrapped in either corn husks or banana leaves, and then steamed until firm and aromatic. The texture is tender, slightly coarse from the ground corn, and deeply infused with the flavors of its filling and wrapping.</p>
