    <h1>Tamales</h1>

    <img src="../images/tamal.png">
    <p>Tamales are one of the oldest and most emblematic foods in Mesoamerican cuisine, with origins that date back over 3,000 years. Long before European contact, Indigenous cultures such as the Maya, Mexica (Aztec), Zapotec, Mixtec, and Purepecha were already preparing tamales as a portable, nourishing food for hunters, warriors, travelers, and ceremonial gatherings.</p>
    <p>At their core, tamales are made from masa — a dough crafted from nixtamalized corn, which undergoes a unique alkaline cooking process that enhances flavor, nutrition, and digestibility. This masa is spread onto corn husks (or banana leaves in southern regions), filled with a wide variety of ingredients, wrapped tightly, and then steamed until the dough becomes firm, aromatic, and fully cooked.</p>
    <p>What makes tamales extraordinary is their infinite regional diversity. Depending on the state, family tradition, and occasion, tamales can be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Savory or sweet</li>
        <li>Spicy or mild</li>
        <li>Stuffed with meats, vegetables, herbs, cheeses, sauces, or fruits</li>
        <li>Wrapped in husks, banana leaves, or even paper</li>
        <li>Miniature (like tamalitos) or massive (like zacahuil)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In central Mexico, common fillings include green salsa with chicken, red adobo pork, rajas with cheese, or sweet masa colored pink and mixed with raisins. In Oaxaca, tamales are traditionally wrapped in banana leaves and filled with mole negro or mole rojo, producing a darker, more aromatic, and very distinctive taste. In Veracruz and Tabasco, tamales often incorporate fish, shrimp, or local herbs, showing how geography shapes flavor.</p>
    <p>Tamales have survived thousands of years because they are incredibly adaptable. They can be rustic or refined, street food or ceremonial offering, fast breakfast or celebratory feast. Whether eaten with atole, champurrado, or coffee, tamales remain a staple of Mexican cuisine and a living connection to ancient culinary traditions.</p>
