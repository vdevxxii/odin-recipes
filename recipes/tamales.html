    <h1>Tamales</h1>

    <img src="../images/tamal.png">

    <p>Tamales are one of the oldest and most iconic dishes of Mesoamerican cuisine, with origins reaching back more than 3,000 years. Long before European contact, Indigenous cultures such as the Maya, Mexica (Aztec), Zapotec, Mixtec, and Purepecha relied on tamales as a portable, nourishing food for hunters, warriors, travelers, and ceremonial gatherings.</p>
    <p>At their foundation, tamales are made from masa — a dough created from nixtamalized corn, a process that enhances flavor, nutrition, and digestibility. The masa is spread onto corn husks (or banana leaves in southern regions), filled with a variety of ingredients, wrapped tightly, and steamed until the dough becomes firm, aromatic, and fully cooked.</p>
    <p>One of the most remarkable qualities of tamales is their regional diversity. Depending on the state, family tradition, and occasion, tamales can be:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Savory or sweet</li>
        <li>Spicy or mild</li>
        <li>Filled with meats, vegetables, herbs, cheese, sauces, or fruits</li>
        <li>Wrapped in husks, banana leaves, or even paper</li>
        <li>Small and delicate or massive, like the famous zacahuil</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In central Mexico, common variations include green salsa with chicken, red adobo pork, rajas with cheese, or sweet pink masa with raisins. Oaxaca is known for tamales wrapped in banana leaves and filled with mole negro or mole rojo, producing a deeper and more aromatic flavor. In Veracruz and Tabasco, tamales often incorporate seafood and regional herbs, highlighting how geography shapes flavor.</p>
    <p>Tamales endure because they are exceptionally adaptable. They can be rustic or refined, street food or ceremonial dish, everyday breakfast or festive centerpiece. Whether served with atole, champurrado, or coffee, tamales remain a living link to Mexico’s ancient culinary traditions.</p>

        <li>250 g lard or vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1–2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2–3 cups chicken broth (added gradually)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>600–800 g pork shoulder or leg, cooked and shredded</li>
        <li>4–5 dried guajillo chiles, seeded</li>
        <li>2 dried ancho chiles, seeded (optional)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>¼ onion</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Prepare the husks</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the corn husks in hot water for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and keep them covered with a towel to stay moist.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Make the red sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the dried chiles until softened.</li>
        <li>Blend the chiles with garlic, onion, some cooking water, and salt.</li>
        <li>Strain for a smoother texture if desired.</li>
        <li>Mix the shredded pork with the sauce and adjust seasoning.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Make the masa</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the lard until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the masa, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add broth gradually, mixing until the dough is soft and spreadable.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Test: a small ball of dough should float in cold water.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>Assemble the tamales</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take a softened corn husk, rough side up.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of masa in the center.</li>
        <li>Add a spoonful of pork filling.</li>
        <li>Fold the sides of the husk in, then fold the bottom up.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Steam</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place tamales upright in a steamer with water at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Cover with extra husks or a cloth, then close the lid.</li>
        <li>Steam over medium heat for 1–1.5 hours.</li>
        <li>They are done when the masa separates cleanly from the husk.</li>
    </ol>
